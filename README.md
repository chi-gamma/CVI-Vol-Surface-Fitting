# Convex Volatility Interpolation

This project implements the Convex Volatility Interpolation method for fitting a volatility surface introduced in [1], showing how to fit a volatility surface while preventing arbitrage.
The (CVI) method for fitting a volatility surface uses a dual parameterization in cubic spline and B-spline spaces calibrated using quadratic programming (QP) with linear constraints. 
This method has no restrictions on the number of parameters, and is able to fit any volatility surface.
